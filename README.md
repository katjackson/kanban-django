## Kanban Board App
-- One Column ToDo App --

This single page app is based on an API I built using Django REST framework. The extremely basic app has registration, login, and logout functionality. 

If logged in, the main page displays a list of task resources. There is a form to create new tasks, utilizing post requests. The edit and delete functions call put and delete requests respectively. All http requests are made through AJAX, so the page never need be refreshed.

## Kanban Board App
-- One Column ToDo App --

This simple app is a single column to-do list. The app is based on an API I built using Django REST framework. All http requests are made through AJAX, so the page never needs to be refreshed. You must register (only providing a username and password) to use the app. Once logged in, the main page displays a list of your tasks. You can create, edit, and delete tasks from this page.

## Kanban Board App

This app is live.

This simple app is a single column to-do list. The app is based on an API I built using Django REST framework. All http requests are made through AJAX, so the page never needs to be refreshed. You must register (only providing a username and password) to use the app. Once logged in, the main page displays a list of your tasks. You can create, edit, and delete tasks from this page. This was my first attempt at creating an API, writing any JavaScript, and deploying a web app using Heroku. This app is live at https://fathomless-wildwood-43598.herokuapp.com/.
